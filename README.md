- 👋 Hi, I’m @SkysBane
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, unity, hacking, running, climbing, learning, and leading.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a unity game dev, and how to be good at PicoCTF
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things with my brother for now, but eventually I'll start looking around at more things I can work on once I prove my abilities.
- 📫 How to reach me: I am SkysBane on most platforms. Nobody else has my name >:). [Discord, itch.io, scratch, github, ect.] and Email = SkysBane@outlook.com. Except on twitter, I'm @TrueSkysBane because some random guy stole skysbane. No idea why :/ {but I also don't use twitter, so that is the least efficient way to contact me. So don't do it.}
